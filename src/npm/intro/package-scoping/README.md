## Requirements


## Observations

* When you load package/file what is the order of operations?
    * What happens if you place a folder in ```node_modules``` folder?
* What happens if it can't find the package in the ```node_modules``` folder? Where does it go next?
* How do you test a module before you publish it?
    * Why is this important?
