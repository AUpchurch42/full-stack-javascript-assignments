# Variables

> What are variables used for? Why are they important?

## Requirements

1. Create the following variables:
    ```js
    export var message = 'hello';

    export let greeting = 'Yo!';

    export const saying = 'What up';
    ```
2. Can you assign a new value to message? (Assign 'world')
3. Can you assign a new value to greeting? (Assign 'Hello!')
4. Can you assign a new value to const? (Assign 'Booyah')


## Observations

1. What it he difference between var and let?
2. What is the difference between let and const?
3. When should you use let versus const?
