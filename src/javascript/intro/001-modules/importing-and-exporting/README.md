#  Modules

> What are modules? Why are they important?

### Requirements

1. Create a name, age, and isTeacher property in the object literal as the default exports.  Use your name, age, and set the isTeacher to `false`.
2. Create an additional export for meaningOfLife = 42
3. Import the `index.js` file in the `imports.js` file.  In the `imports.js` file export the meaning of life from the `index.js` file as the default.
4. Create a me export in the `imports.js`. Use the default export from the `index.js`.


### Observations

* Why are modules important? How do I make something public? private?
* What is the difference from the default and exporting a variable?
* When would you want to export default?  When wouldn't you?
