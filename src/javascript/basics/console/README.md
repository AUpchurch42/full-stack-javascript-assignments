# Console

> What is the purpose of the console? How is it helpful?

## Requirements

1. Create a tyler object:
    ```js
    const tyler = {
      name: 'Tyler Garlick',
      age: 35,
      address: {
        street: '123 somewhere',
        city: 'Somewhere',
        state: 'UT',
        zip: '84129'
      }
    };
    ```
2. Create a bob object:
    ```js
    const bob = {
      name: 'Bob the Buidler',
      age: 30,
      address: {
        street: '123 somewhere',
        city: 'Somewhere',
        state: 'UT',
        zip: '84129'
      }
    };
    ```
3. Create a people array: ```const people = [tyler, bob];```
4. Use console.log to output the tyler object.
5. Use console.log to output the bob object.
6. Use console.log to output the people array.
7. Use console.log to output the console object
    a. What does that tell you about the console object?

## Observations

* Why would you use the console object?
* Why would you use console vs. [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)?
    * How are they the same?
    * How are they different?
* What other tools could you use that are similar?
