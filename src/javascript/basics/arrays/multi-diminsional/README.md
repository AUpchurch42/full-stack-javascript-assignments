#  Assignment Multi-dimensional

> Why are multi-dimensional arrays important? 
 
## Requirements
1. Create a multi-dimensional array:
    ```js
    export const Matrix = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
    ];
    ```
    1. Traverse this array so the console outputs 1, 2, 3... to 9
2. Create a jagged multi-dimensional array:
    ```js
    export const Jagged = [
      [1, 2],
      [3, 5, 6, 7, 8],
      [9]
    ];
    ```

## Observations

1. What can a multi-dimensional array be used for?
2. Do the types need to be the same for a multi-dimensional array?
3. Write a function that is able to traverse both arrays
