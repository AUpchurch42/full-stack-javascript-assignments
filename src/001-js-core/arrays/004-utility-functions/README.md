# Assignment - Array Functions

>  How do we operate on arrays?

For this assignment you will traverse different types of arrays utilizing various functions.


### Requirements

1. Create an array of numbers with all the prime numbers between 1 - 100 in the ```Primes``` constant
2. Create an array of strings with all the English vowels in the ```Vowels``` constant
3. Create an array of objects with all the presidents in the ```Presidents``` constant
    * The president object should look like:
        ```js
        {
            name: "George Washington",
            birthday: 1732,
            death: 1799,
            tookOffice: "1789-04-30",
            leftOffice: "1797-03-04",
            party: "No Party"
         }
        ```


### Observations

* What are arrays good for?
* What does an empty array look like?
* Are there other types like arrays in ES2015?
    * How are they they same?
    * How are they different?
